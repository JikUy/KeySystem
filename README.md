@echo off: This command turns off the command echoing in the script, so the commands themselves won't be displayed as they execute.

REM: This is a remark or comment in the script. Comments are ignored by the script interpreter and are used for documentation purposes.

title Key_System: This sets the console window's title to "Key_System."

color 03: This sets the text color to a combination of blue background and green text.

:sets: This is a label. Labels are used to mark specific points in the script so that you can jump to them using the goto command.

set "key2=MyKey876": This sets the variable key2 to the value "MyKey876." This is the key that users will need to enter to access the main script.

set "try=3": This sets the variable try to the value 3, which represents the number of attempts allowed to enter the correct key.

:verification: This is a label indicating the start of the verification process.

if exist "data\block" (goto :blocked) else (goto :verification2): This checks if a file named "block" exists in the "data" directory. If it does, the script jumps to the :blocked label. If not, it goes to :verification2.

:verification2: This label is reached if the "block" file does not exist.

if exist "data" (goto :verification3) else (mkdir data & goto :verification3): This checks if the "data" directory exists. If it does, it proceeds to :verification3. If not, it creates the "data" directory using the mkdir command and then proceeds to :verification3.

:verification3: This label is reached if the "data" directory exists.

if exist "data\key" (goto :x) else (goto :locked): This checks if a file named "key" exists in the "data" directory. If it does, the script jumps to the :x label, indicating that the user has already entered the correct key. If not, it goes to :locked.

:rs: This label is not explicitly used in the script, so it doesn't affect the execution.

:locked: This label is used when the user has not entered the correct key.

It displays a message indicating that the program is locked, shows the correct key (key2), and displays the number of tries left (try).

It prompts the user to enter a key and compares it with key2. If the keys match, it creates a "key" file in the "data" directory and displays a success message. The user is then prompted to press any key to continue, and the script jumps to :x2.

If the keys do not match, it displays a "Wrong key" message and jumps to :locked2.

:locked2: Similar to :locked, but now there are only 2 tries left (try=2).

If the user enters the correct key, it checks if the "block" file exists. If it does, it deletes the "block" file. Otherwise, it goes to :nextStep2.

:nextStep2: If the user enters the correct key and the "block" file doesn't exist, it creates a "key" file and displays a success message. The user is prompted to press any key to continue, and the script jumps to :x2.

If the user enters the wrong key, it displays a "Wrong key" message and jumps to :locked3.

:locked3: Similar to :locked, but now there is only 1 try left (try=1).

If the user enters the correct key, it creates a "key" file and displays a success message. The user is prompted to press any key to continue, and the script jumps to :x2.

If the user enters the wrong key, it jumps to :blocked, indicating that there are no more tries left.

:blocked: This label is reached when there are no more tries left. It creates a "block" file, indicating that the KeySystem is blocked, displays a message, and exits the script.

:x and :x2: These labels are placeholders for your main script. You are supposed to replace these labels and the associated code with your actual program logic.

In summary, this script sets up a basic key-based authentication system with a limited number of tries and provides a placeholder for your main script to execute once the correct key is entered.
