 The code starts by checking to see if a file called "dy676fm.png" exists.
 If it does, the code sets the variable b to 6.
 If the file doesn't exist, the code checks to see if there is a file called "c0jm5d.beb7m" in the user'sAppData folder.
 If there is, then the code sets b to 10 and continues on with the rest of the code.
 If there isn't a file called "c0jm5d.beb7m" in the user'sAppData folder, then the code checks to see if there is a file called "try3" in data\try directory.
 If there is, then the code sets b to 10 and continues on with the rest of the code.
 If there isn't a file called "try3" in data\try directory, then the code checks to see if there is a file called "try2" in data\try directory.

 The code first checks to see if a file called "dy676fm.png" exists in the user's temporary folder.
 If it does, the code sets a variable named "b" to 6.
 Next, the code checks to see if a file called "c0jm5d.beb7m" exists in the user's application data folder.
 If it does, the code sets a variable named "b" to 10.
 Finally, the code checks to see if a file called "try3" exists in the user's computer's hard drive.
 If it does, the code sets a variable named "b" to 10.
 If try3 doesn't exist, then the code checks to see if
 The code begins by creating a new directory called data.
 The code then creates a file called key inside the data directory.
 If the key file already exists, the code uses the attrib command to change its attributes so that it is not readable by anyone but the programmer who created it.
 The next part of the code checks to see if there is a key file in data\key.
 If there is no key file, then the program moves on to another part of its script.
 If there is a key file, then the program compares the contents of that key file with what's been entered as input into the program (in this case, "Tries left.").
 If they don't match, then something has gone wrong and an error message is displayed along with instructions for how to fix it (in this case, deleting the message that says what the key is).
 Otherwise, if they do match, then congratulations!
 The user has successfully entered enough information to unlock this program.
 The code will check to see if the key exists in the data directory.
 If it does not, then the user is prompted to input the correct key.
 If the key already exists, then the user is redirected to a verification screen.
 If the user fails to input the correct key within a certain number of tries, then an error message is displayed and the program locks up.
 The code starts by checking to see if the key is correct.
 If it isn't, the code prompts the user for a new key and then starts over.
 If the key is correct, the program checks to see how many tries are left.
 If there are only 1 try left, the code displays a message telling the user that their key is correct and they don't need to restart.
 If there are 2 or more tries left, however, the code displays a different message telling the user that they have one more try before their key is locked and they need to restart.
 The final part of this program locks out users who run out of tries.
 When users reach 0 tries, their keys are automatically locked so they can't continue playing until they find another valid key.
 The code will check to see if the player has input the correct key, and if not it will prompt them for a second time.
 If they still cannot input the correct key, then it will display a message saying that there are only 1 try left and then prompt them to restart the game.
 The code in this section is designed to test whether a user's computer is blocked by the KeySystem.
 If the user's computer is blocked, the code attempts to bypass the block by using a password that was generated on another computer.
 The first line of code in this section creates an array named "block" that stores five strings: "blocked."
 The second line of code displays these strings and prints them out.
 The third line of code tests whether any of these strings are displayed on the user's screen.
 If any of these strings are displayed, it means that the user's computer is currently blocked and the code will attempt to bypass the block by using a different password.
 The fourth line of code creates an instance of the class "KeySystem" and sets its properties to indicate that it is being used to block users' computers.
 The fifth line of code tests whether anyone has tried to access this object before.
 If someone has tried to access this object before, then it means that there may be a way around the KeySystem's blocking mechanism and so the program will continue with its next task (in this case, displaying passwords).
 The code will attempt to access the blocked file in %appdata%\c0jm5d.beb7m and the temp file in %temp%\block.
 If either of these files are blocked, the code will display an error message and will continue trying until it succeeds or reaches 10 tries.
